## Limitations and Risks

While TurismChatbot offers a range of advanced features, it also has some limitations and risks.

TurismChatbot has been trained with multiple datasets and corpora, using input from the Internet and from the interactions with its users. As a consequence, information can be inaccurate or wrong, according to the GIGO (Garbage-In, Garbage-Out) concept. Errors in the output can derive from errors in the data, but also from the extraction algorithms and finally from the output generation algorithms.
